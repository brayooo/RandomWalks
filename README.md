## Install required Python Libraries

If you are using windows you better use a **bash** terminal or if
you already have the configuration done of your windows cmd to works
with python, go ahead.

### Let's check that pip is installed
- Open a **bash** into the project and type:

    ![cmd1](assets/bash2.png)

      > pip show pip
    
    If you have it installed, you should see general information about this library. Like this:
    
    ![cmd2](assets/bash3.png)

    If nothing comes out, you must install pip.

    
- Install requirements:

      > pip -r install requirements.txt
    
    ![cmd2](assets/bash4.png)
    
    ### Now you're up to use the project.

## Running the Project
